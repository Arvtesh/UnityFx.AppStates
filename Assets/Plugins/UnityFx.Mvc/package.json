    "description": "As outlined in [ASP.NET Core documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/mvc/overview), the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern separates an application into three main groups of components: Models, Views, and Controllers. This pattern helps to achieve separation of concerns. Using this pattern, user requests are routed to a Controller which is responsible for working with the Model to perform user actions and/or retrieve results of queries. The Controller chooses the View to display to the user, and provides it with any Model data it requires.

In the same way that MVC takes the position that you should separate model logic from view and controller logic, MVCS takes this notion a step further by advocating for application logic to live in the services. This is the recommended way of sharing pieces of logic between controllers.",
