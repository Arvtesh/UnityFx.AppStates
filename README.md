## Understanding the concepts
TODO

## Motivation
The project was initially created to help author with his [Unity3d](https://unity3d.com) projects. Client .NET applications in general (and Unity applications specifically) do not have a standard structure or any kind of architecturing guidelines (like ASP.NET). This is an attempt to create a small yet effective and usable application framework suitable for most Unity projects.
